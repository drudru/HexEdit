HexEdit Revision History

01/01/25 Version 1.66
	Nick Shanks added a Window menu
	Option menu was re-arranged a little
	Moved mac_Offscreen code to EditWindow.c
	Nav services dialogs are now movable modal
	Pressing TAB switches the edit cursor between the Hex and ASCII panes
	Added the ability to click on the URL's in the about box to launch a web browser
	Added Fat Carbon post-linker to the FAT build, so that it builds an intelligent FAT app
		(note: I licensed Fat Carbon for HexEdit, so it's legal to ship with this :)
	Nick Shanks seperated the headers out into more relavent files
	Added the licensing text to each source file for SourceForge distribution
	Re-arranged the directory structure to help with CVS distribution
	Re-arranged some of the support text files for CVS distribution
	Icons are now a seperate resource file so that you can create/choose what you like
	Some very  minor bugs and code cleanup went on as well

01/01/01 Version 1.65
	Re-arranged menus, thanks to Stephane Moureau for the suggestion!
	Comparing a file against itself is no longer allowed! (Stephane Moureau)
	Lines per page count was one short, fixed (found via bug where select all didn't select last line, per Stephane Moureau)
	Find dialog disables Match Case option for hex cause you can't match case in hex (per Stephane Moureau)
	File Compare no longer retries selections if canceled at second selection. (per Stephane Moureau)
	Pasting bad information no longer creates an undo event (per Stephane Moureau)
	The "debug" button was removed from the main error dialog.
		(But, you can now press "OPTION" when clicking the dismiss button to drop into the debugger.)
		(Of course, if you don't have a debugger you will crash!)
	All alerts and dialogs were cleaned up to conform to UI guidelines and not be so ugly :)
	Edit other Fork & Compare files options are now in the File menu, where they make sense
	Renamed some other menu items to make things a bit more logical
	Fixed a weird problem with files being disposed of during editing. How'd that happen?!?
	Spelled Avocado correctly (per Stephane Moureau)
	Goto Address was messing with the "Address:" text as a user item, for reasons unkown to me. Removed.
	Goto dialog is now modeless :)
	Find dialog now ALWAYS has find buttons disabled if no text entered :) (dang global vars!)
	Cleaned up references to and use of dialog and alert ID's
	Hi Order ASCII option was not being set on load (per Toru Yoshizawa)
	Print menu text now now in a resource (STR# 129) to enable localization (per Jean-Jacques Cortes)
	Pretty new icons provided (including 32 bit) by Jean-Jacques Cortes!
	'dlgx' resources now included to make HexEdit appearance manager friendly (per Jean-Jacques Cortes)
	Labeled string resources to make localization task easier
	Display selected area (start and stop, both same for position with no selection). Suggested by Adrian Walti
	Added 'Home' and 'End' keys to go to beginning and end of file respectively
	Changed selection update method to always update header
	Updated the readme file to be accurate with all the changes
	Changed version and readme files to times and added some styling for readability
	Totally re-wrote the copy/paste functionality for better system performance and Carbon compatability
	Changed the manner in which copies operate:
			Hex side copies ASCII hex, binary side copies binary (raw) data
			Hex side always pastes binary, binary side pastes raw clipboard (ie, hex copy pastes ascii rep in binary colum)
			(the downside to this is that a "bad" ASCII hex representation will paste as binary data instead of erroring out)
	Removed the "shift-copy" feature, since we now have this automated method of selecting which copy to do
	Color selection is only enabled for valid windows. (ie, a B&W window can't be changed to a color window!)
	Header strings now in STR# resource for localization
	Error strings now in STR# resource for localization. Also contain more information (like the error code :)
	Fixed window proc id (not sure how it got messed up)
	Goto Address menu option is how Cmd-J (to conform to CodeWarrior and other "standards")
	Find and Goto dialogs now remember position within a single run (positions NOT saved between runs)
	Adjusted window size to always show complete lines by default (David Emme)
	Fixed "Edit Other Fork" where it would open a new window instead of selecting the open window (Stephane Moureau)
	Fixed headers drawing in incorrect color during background updates
	Fixed minor menu enabling glitch when no windows were open
	Disabled the printing options under Carbon until I get Carbon/OS X printing working
	Added really cool new about box! Now contributors can get their names listed where everyone sees them :)


09/23/00 Version 1.6 (never released publicly)
	First pass at Carbonization! Scrap & Printing needs finishing, and I'd like make it superfat.
		Thanks to Nick Shanks and George Warner for their efforts in Carbonizing HexEdit!
	Carbon version uses Navigation Services.
	Many intrnal modifications to the code for Carbon compatibility
	Fixed (for good?) the bad case of opening files (-34). For some reason, having the check
		for locating a unique filename withing the "while" statement caused the error
		to be ignored at times, and then a bogus random name would be created.
	Fixed lock up when the find window or compare dialog was open.
	Added optional vertical bars (based on mod sent by David Emme)
	Find dialog is not visable during setup
	Find dialog buttons no longer flicker (thanks to Max Horn)
	Find dialog accepts return or enter as acceptance
	Updated to CWPro 6 (for ease of Carbon support)
	Optimization level now set to max and smaller code size.

05/10/00 Version 1.5
	Made promise to self to update HexEdit web site so people know I actually work on HexEdit :)
	Moved all preferences to prefences structure.
	Made preferences actually work. (can't believe this bug was never reported!)
	Fixed bug w/appending ~ to max length filenames (temp files, reported by Ritchie)
	Fixed memory leak in DisposeChunk (reported by Nick Shanks)
	Finally found where the bogus errors were being generated on file opens & fixed it!
		(historical note; the routine to ensure unique temp filenames was very buggy)
		(darn: still a bug w/opening new windows returning an error -34 on occassion)
	Integrated modifications by Nick Shanks (appearing in Nick's 1.3 release):
		Made search buttons disable when there's nothing entered for which to search
		Shifted scroll bar, removed footer and tidied up code
	Added Color Schemes, based on idea by Nick Shanks. Off by default due to memory usage
		(historical note: it's a bad idea to use "SetPortBits" on color windows!)

You can create/edit color schemes by editing the 'HEct' resources in HexEdit. If you create a cool scheme and want it included in the next HexEdit release, just send me the scheme's 'HEct' resource.

Note: Using color windows takes 8Ñ32 times as much memory! So, if you are short on memory, have a large desktop (1024x768 or higher) or want lots of open windows, turn "Use Color" off (ie, it's not checked) before opening windows. HexEdit will remember your color usage preference the next time it is launched.

11/30/99 Version 1.4.3
	Fixed system hilight color support reported by Tim Herzog.
	Added Tim's ASCII cut/copy mod. From Tim:

ÒBasically if you hold down the shift key when you cut/copy, it copies the selection to the system scrap in ASCII not in binary, so the TEXT scrap resembles the display in HexEdit.  It's handy when you want to copy the asii representation, not the pure binary.Ó

8/19/99 Version 1.4.2
	Fixed bug reported by Jean-Pierre Melkonian (don't test for case in hex searches!)

6/5/99 Version 1.4.1
	Fixed bug reported by Jonathan Write, where deleting text could corrupt a file
	Improved menu operation, as reported by Aaron D. (ie, open works w/find dlg active)
	Updated to CWPro 5 and turned on optimizations for PPC build

8/31/98 Version 1.4
	Preferences are now saved in the active system preferences folder
	Changed "ignore case" to be the default search method
	Some interface cleanup
	A few VOODOO integration adjustments
	Fix "Edit Other Fork" option

7/16/98 Version 1.3.1
	Added "ignore case" option to Find dialog.
	Fixed HexEdit's use of CPU time (was always 99%), now it's 5% foreground, <1% background)
	If activated w/file compare windows open, display file compare dialog.
  		(ie, if VOODOO activates us to show differences, then replicate Compare Files operation.)
	Open Dialog is back at startup, but only if not started up to do a file compare.
	Removed a few DebugStr's that could confuse users

6/24/98 Version 1.3
	Added support for VOODOO AE compare suite.
	HexEdit no longer starts up with the open file dialog (required by above change)

4/19/98 Version 1.22
	CWPro r3 project
	Fixed a few bugs related to empty data/resource forks
		(still a few hard-to-fix ones remaining, but should no longer crash.)

	CWPro r1 multi-target & MSL re-compile (added 15K too, sigh)
	Fixed a crash bug when trying to insert data into an empty fork

	Sources no longer require OLDROUTINENAMES to compile

6/6/96 Version 1.2
	Now a "fat" application, sources Universal Headers happy
	Add better file compare, allow setting compare options
	Add ability to switch between both forks of a file
	Remove all warnings from the compile
	Fixed a few bugs relating to Power PC usage

11/9/95 Version 1.1  (unreleased)
