FILE PURPOSE:

This is to track changes made to files checked in. This is NOT the history file! This is a work-in-progress file. used to inform other programers of what you have changed., what to watch out for, any problems, and other items of interest.

This file will be culled to update the version history file for official releases. (ie, for each official release this file is emptied!)

1.7
2001-02-17 Lane Roathe <lane@roathe.com>
Fixed all the lines per page calculations! Many a bug are fixed :)
	(inspired by Scott, who sent in a try at a printed page lines per page fix)
Printing errors in Carbon now report error code
Removed MaxWindowHeight constant since this is calculated now
Renamed MaxWindowWidth to HexWindowWidth since it's a constant (not sizeable)
Added new pref, partialLines, to control constraining window resizing to full lines (or not)
Fixed zoom to be 1/2 height, not moving to the right ... huh?
Min window height no longer based on scroll bar size (not there!)
Major cleanup to the drawing code ... what a mess :(
Got tired of not knowing what was a constant and what wasn't (use kConstant, MACRO)
Dang, SBarSize was being used for the # of bytes per line! Fixed!
Added Zoom ability to carbon build
Fixed Zoom - it was flat broke! (no idea why moving it right was considered a "zoom")
	(note: Window's actually start fully zoomed, and zooming unzooms...should this be changed?)

First pass at cleaning up printing code so printing is actually usable :)
Made a few local routines static and renamed to _functionName format
Fixed about box not handling URL clicks (forgot to check in AboutBox.h)
Fixed NULL window ptrs to CarbonLib in UpdateMenus (g.searcWin, etc.)
