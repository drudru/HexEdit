FILE PURPOSE:

This is to track changes made to files checked in. This is NOT the history file! (See the release package's "History.txt" for that) This is a work-in-progress file used to inform other programers of what you have changed, what to watch out for, any problems, and other items of interest.

This file will be culled to update the version history file for official releases. (ie, for each official release this file is emptied!)
